# ATM-System
This is a simple ATM simulation project built in Java. It demonstrates the use of loops, conditionals, and switch-case to perform basic ATM operations.  The program allows a user to log in with username and PIN, then perform banking tasks like balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, deposit, and PIN reset.
